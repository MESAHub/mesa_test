# MESATest
Command line tool for running the MESA test suite and uploading results to MESATestHub

I'll flesh this out later, but ideally you should install via

    gem install mesa_test
    
Then learn about the available commands via

    mesa_test help
    
For an individual command, call `help` with an argument:

    mesa_test help test_one
